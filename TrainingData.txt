(Note: A non-cohabiting caregiver must spend sufficient time with the subject so that, in the opinion of the Investigator, the caregiver can reliably assess cognitive function, activities and behavior, and report on the subject's compliance and health. As caregiver time spent with a potential subject is anticipated to be highly variable across countries and cultures, GSK will consider a variety of different measures by which this stipulation may be met, and GSK should be consulted if adequacy of a caregiver situation is in doubt. However, as guidance, the ability for a caregiver to meet his/her expected responsibilities for this study would normally be possible when the caregiver spends no less than 10 hours per week with the subject, divided over multiple days.)
